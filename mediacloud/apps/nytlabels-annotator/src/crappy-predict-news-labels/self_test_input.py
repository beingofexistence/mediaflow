South Park creators mock the NBA with a sarcastic apology to China
===

The producers of the American animated sitcom South Park issued a sarcastic apology to China after Beijing censors
deleted every trace of the cartoon on all video streaming services and social media platforms within mainland China.

The apology, published on October 7, mocks the American National Basketball Association (NBA) for bringing “the Chinese
censors into our homes and into our hearts”. The humorous statement follows a global online row caused by a tweet posted
by Daryl Morey, the general manager of Houston Rockets, a team playing in the NBA, in which he supports the Hong Kong
protesters for more political freedom and oppose Beijing policies.

What triggered the Chinese censors’ action is the latest episode of the series, called “Band in China”. It depicts one
of the main characters, Randy, on a business trip in China during which he lands in jail where he meets Disney
characters including Winnie the Pooh and Piglet.

The episode, which mocks Hollywood for its self-censorship practices in China, was released on October 2, just one day
after the 70th anniversary of the foundation of the People's Republic of China.

The episode shocked some of the cartoon's fans both inside and outside China for its violent scenes, which is typical of
the series since its debut in 1997.
