						A service could be e.g. your official website, your CRM system, your support application, or even your printers.
						 Services are logical groups which can include hosts, routers, switches, firewalls, CRMs, ERPs, websites and numerous other services. 
						 By the following example, you're able to see more clearly what a service is:
							A chip manufacturer sells computers by its website all around the world. 
							His company consists of three big departments: A management, an on-line shop and support."
