# Accessibility

Accessibility is important for users who use screen readers or rely on keyboard-only functionality
to ensure they have an equivalent experience to sighted mouse users.

## Accessibility best practices

Follow these [best practices](best_practices.md) to implement accessible web applications. These are
some of the topics covered in that guide:

- [Quick checklist](best_practices.md#quick-checklist)
- [Accessible names for screen readers](best_practices.md#provide-accessible-names-for-screen-readers)
- [Icons](best_practices.md#icons)
- [When to use ARIA](best_practices.md#when-to-use-aria)

## Automated accessibility testing

Uncover accessibility problems and ensure that your features stay accessible over time by
[implementing automated A11Y tests](automated_testing.md).

- [When to add accessibility tests](automated_testing.md#when-to-add-accessibility-tests)
- [How to add accessibility tests](automated_testing.md#how-to-add-accessibility-tests)
